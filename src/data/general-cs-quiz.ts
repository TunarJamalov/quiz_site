    Question: "In terms of Big-O complexity, what is the time complexity for lookups in a binary tree index?", 
    Answer: "O(log n)",
    Distractor1: "O(n)",
    Distractor2: "O(n log n)",
    Distractor3: "O(1)",
    Explanation: 
      "This is because a binary tree index allows for efficient searching by halving the search space at each step.",
